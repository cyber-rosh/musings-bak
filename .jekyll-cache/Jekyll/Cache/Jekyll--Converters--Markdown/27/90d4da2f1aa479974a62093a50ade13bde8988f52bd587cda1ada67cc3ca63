I"ª<p>Let us take a use case in which a small to medium sized enterprise wants to scale up the security infrastructure of their internet facing website. They have this conventional architecture in which the website is hosted on Virtual Private Server (VPS). What can be done immediately, for upgrading the security posture of the hosted website, without actually going into the codebase or the workflow of the website itself.</p>
